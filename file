Project Description
Finding business insights that can be used by teams across the business to launch a new marketing campaign, decide on features to build for an app, track the success of the app by measuring user engagement and improve the experience altogether while helping the business grow.

Approach
Database creation: Created and inserted the values in the database using the DDL & DML SQL queries provided by the product manager (as per project) in the MySQL database using MySQL workbench.


Extraction of insights: After creating the database required insights are generated from the database tables by running SQL queries in MySQL workbench.

Tech-Stack Used
Used MySQL Community Server — GPL Version 8.0.29 and Connector Version C++ 8.0.29 for creating my project as MySQL Community Server — GPL is a free and open-source relational database management system that uses SQL.

# 4.Hashtag Researching: A partner brand wants to know, which hashtags to use in the post to reach the most people on the platform.

Insights: investor metrics
# 1. User Engagement: Are users still as active and post on Instagram or they are making fewer posts.

SELECT (SELECT Count(id)
        FROM   photos) / (SELECT Count(DISTINCT user_id)
                          FROM   photos) AS Average_posts_per_User,
       (SELECT Count(id)
        FROM   photos) / (SELECT Count(id)
